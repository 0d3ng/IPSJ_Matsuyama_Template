  abstract  = {Nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become widely used at various places and for various applications. To facilitate this trend, we have developed the IoT application server platform called SEMAR (Smart Environmental Monitoring and Analytical in Real-Time), which offers standard features for collecting, displaying, and analyzing sensor data. An edge device is usually installed to connect sensors with the server, where the interface configuration, the data processing, the communication protocol, and the transmission interval need to be defined by the user. In this paper, we proposed an edge device framework for SEMAR to remotely optimize the edge device utilization with three phases. In the initialization phase, it automatically downloads the configuration file to the device through HTTP communications. In the service phase, it converts data from various sensors into the standard data format and sends it to the server periodically. In the update phase, it remotely updates the configuration through MQTT communications. For evaluations, we applied the proposal to the fingerprint-based indoor localization system (FILS15.4) and the data logging system. The results confirm the effectiveness in utilizing SEMAR to develop IoT application systems.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, a new encryption algorithm Twine-Mersenne was developed based on the Twine algorithm with the addition of a random number generator for the dynamic generation of S-boxes. Dynamic generation of random numbers based on the Mersenne Twister helps to increase the cryptographic strength of the proposed algorithm. The algorithm we propose solves the issues of optimizing the costs of computing and energy resources of internet of things (IoT) devices, using a combination of lightweight cryptographic principles and fuzzy logic, and also provides reliable security and intelligent authentication of the mobile application user. The paper also considers the practical implementation of the proposed algorithm based on Arduino ESP32, a device with limited computing resources. In addition to this, fuzzy logic has found its practical application in the field of intelligent user authentication in developed mobile applications based on Arduino Studio for mobile cellular applications. As a result, the proposed lightweight encryption algorithm has proven itself to be an effective tool in ensuring the security of data transmission and communication between IoT devices.},

  abstract  = {The Internet of Things (IoT) can be considered as a physical object that connects and exchanges data with other objects over networks. IoTs transmit different types of personal healthcare information, critical data, and other items, via the Internet. This data becomes a target of security issues. Therefore, the security of this data is vital to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of the data by using lightweight encryption. Due to the minimal resources available to these IoT devices, IoT requires other techniques to deal with these limitations, such as the compression methods to decrease data size and increase the speed of transmission. In this paper, the proposed system combines compression and lightweight encryption techniques to decrease the data size and protect it. The collected data from the IoT sensor is compressed by using the Zstandard algorithm, after which the compressed data is encrypted using the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in the gateway and sent to the fog server. Besides, the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman is used as the key exchange protocol among the IoT device layer to the Fog layer. The hardware used in the proposal is the Raspberry Pi model 4 and two types of sensors. The results show that the system reduces the size of the transmitted data in about 79% for 36.58 GB, and provides better security with the encryption and decryption time of about 0.36 msec for 100-byte data size, while its throughput is 277.7 byte/msec.},
